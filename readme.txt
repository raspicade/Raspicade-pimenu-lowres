=PiMenu for Raspberry Pi by Squid=

*INTRODUCTION*

This is a simple menu for running the various emulators I've written for the Raspberry Pi. It is also easily configurable to add other emulators as required.

Only detected emulators will be displayed, by default it looks in the locations used by the Pi Store versions.

*CONTROLS*

Keyboard arrow keys, return or control to start.
Joystick button 0 or start to start a game.

All controls are configurable by editing the "pimenu.cfg" file.


*INSTALLATION*
{{{
pimenu        -> Game binary
pimenu.cfg    -> configuration file
ICON[012].bmp -> Default ICONs used for the game emulators
}}}

To run PiMenu simple run the "pimenu" executable. 

It will work in X-Windows or in the Console.


*CONFIGURATION*
You can add/edit emulators in the [General] section of the pimenu.cfg file. Each emulator to appear requires an "icon_command_" section pointing to the executable and an equivalent icon in the pimenu directory, called "ICON_3.bmp" (for example the number 3 emulator). The number needs to match the icon and the "icon_command_". Also make sure the "icon_count" matches the number of entries.
Optionally you can add a "icon_args_" section to pass arguments to a command.

The icon must be size 192x192 and uncompressed bitmap with a white background. The following ImageMagick command creates the correct format:
convert ICON.png -resize 192x192 -compress none bmp3:ICON3.bmp

The "kioskmode" can be set to "1" to stop the menu quitting.
